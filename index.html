			<p>	<span id="first-letter">W</span>hen you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The
			people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful,
			arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this
			because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the
			beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized
			that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of
			the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a
			share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one
			can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my
			relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like
			feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and
			lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at
			someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>2.</strong> Whatever this is that I am, it is flesh and a little spirit and
			an intelligence. Throw away your books; stop letting yourself
			be distracted. That is not allowed. Instead, as if you were
			dying right now, despise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces
			of bone, a woven tangle of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider
			what the spirit is: air, and never the same air, but vomited out and gulped in again every instant. Finally, the intelligence.
			Think of it this way: You are an old man. Stop allowing your
			mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to
			kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>3.</strong> What is divine is full of Providence. Even chance is not
			divorced from nature, from the inweaving and enfolding of
			things governed by Providence. Everything proceeds from it.
			And then there is necessity and the needs of the whole world,
			of which you are a part. Whatever the nature of the whole
			does, and whatever serves to maintain it, is good for every
			part of nature. The world is maintained by change—in the
			elements and in the things they compose. That should been
			enough for you; treat it as an axiom. Discard your thirst for
			books, so that you won’t die in bitterness, but in cheerfulness and truth, grateful to the gods from the bottom of your heart.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>4.</strong> Remember how long you’ve been putting this off, how
			many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them.
			At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you
			belong to; what power rules it and from what source you
			spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if
			you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone and willingly never return.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>5.</strong> Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on
			doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine
			seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing
			yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do
			everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your
			life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions
			override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical,
			self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to
			do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage
			this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.</p>
